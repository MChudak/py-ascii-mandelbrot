[this program serves mostly my own training purposes, to learn python & git]

Very simple mandelbrot fractal generator, written in python. That's my first program in this language, and first uploaded to git :)

compile-py-ascii-mandel is a bash script that compiles code using python and 7zips the image - if you don't have 7z, don't use it!
